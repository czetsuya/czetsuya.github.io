In this course, we will use the power of Spring + RESTful Web Services to develop the system. We will also architect the application to use a microservice approach which allows for more modular development. We will separate the catalog and sales system into two separate microservices having their own database. Thus, there will be a problem in reporting which we will address using API Composition and Saga Pattern.

Once we are done with the RESTful web services, we will create a simple front end application secured by Keycloak to show some reports.

And finally, we will dockerize the services and managed using Kubernetes. We will also attempt to deploy the application on Amazon Web Services using a docker-compose and Amazon EKS.
